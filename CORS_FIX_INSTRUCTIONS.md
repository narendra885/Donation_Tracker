# üîß URGENT: Fix Google Apps Script CORS Issue

## Problem
You're getting "Connection error: Failed to fetch" because your Google Apps Script doesn't have CORS headers configured properly.

## Solution
You need to update your Google Apps Script with the CORS fixes I just added to the code.

## üìã Steps to Fix:

### 1. Open Your Google Apps Script
- Go to: https://script.google.com/
- Open your existing "Donation Tracker" project

### 2. Replace the Code.gs File
- Select all content in Code.gs (Ctrl+A)
- Delete it
- Copy the entire content from: `google-apps-script/Code.gs` in this folder
- Paste it into your Google Apps Script editor

### 3. Save and Deploy
- Click **Save** (Ctrl+S)
- Click **Deploy** button (top right)
- Click **Manage deployments**
- Click the **pencil icon** (edit) next to your existing deployment
- Change **Version** to "New version"
- Click **Deploy**
- Copy the new Web App URL (it might be the same as before)

### 4. Test the Fix
- Go back to your website: https://narendra885.github.io/Donation_Tracker/
- Try logging in with: `8392680202`
- It should now work in Live Mode without "Failed to fetch" errors

## üõ†Ô∏è What I Fixed:
- Added CORS headers to all responses
- Added `doOptions()` function for preflight requests
- Added proper Access-Control headers

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes:
- You MUST update the Google Apps Script code for this to work
- The website code is already updated and pushed to GitHub
- After updating Apps Script, test immediately

## üÜò If Still Having Issues:
1. Make sure you deployed with "Execute as: Me"
2. Make sure "Who has access" is set to "Anyone"
3. Try using an incognito/private browser window
4. Check browser console for detailed error messages

Let me know once you've updated the Google Apps Script!
